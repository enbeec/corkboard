# Corkboard

## a react-dnd demo

This app combines the [naive drag around example](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/examples/drag-around/naive) with the [simple sortable example](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/examples/sortable/simple).

Different kinds of data can be displayed within the corkboard, either in the list part to the right or as a draggable card in the board part to the left.

See the diagram for more details:
